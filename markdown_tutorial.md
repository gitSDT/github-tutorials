#Customizing Text with Markdown

Markdown is a a markup language that allows to you to control how your text looks. It is easy to read and understand by most people, and works similarly regardless of browser or platform, while still keeping pages lightweight.

##Why Use Markdown?
1.  Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email      messages, and technical documentation.

1. Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application. 

1. Markdown is platform independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating         system.

1. Markdown is future proof. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be    able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. This is an important consideration when it     comes to books, university theses, and other milestone documents that need to be preserved indefinitely.

1. Markdown is everywhere. Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based         applications support it.

##Headings
To create headings for your paragraphs and sections, you can add hash signs before the line to signify the level of importance the line should have.

# This is the highest level of the text.
## This is the second highest level of the text.
### Each hash mark creates a new level of text for headers.
#### These are useful for subsections for large chunks of information.
##### There are six different headers you can use for text.
###### This is sixth section!
